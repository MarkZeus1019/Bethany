                            <h2>How we make this pie</h2>
                            <ol type="A">
                                <li>First we combine sugar, flour and spices. We toss the apples with some lemon juice and add sugar.</li>
                                <li>We then create the bottom crust and fill that with apple mixture. We put some butteron that. We then roll remaining crust to fit top of pie.</li>
                                <li>Then we beat eggs white until we have a foamy mix. That is them brushed over the crust. We sprinkle some extra sugar.</li>
                                <li>Then the pie goes into the oven at 360 for 35 minutes. When ready, we let it cool on a wire rock.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <ol start="5">
                                <li>If something goes wrong, we start all over again!</li>
                            </ol>
